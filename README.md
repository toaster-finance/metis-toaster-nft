## Introduction

Toaster Items Contract is a collectible NFT system that allows users to create, manage, and customize their profile NFTs on the Toaster Finance platform. Each NFT represents a unique user profile that can be customized with various attributes based on their DeFi activities on Metis.

## System Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the interaction flow between different components of the system:

The system uses Alchemy Webhook for image generation, ensuring efficient and automated profile image creation upon minting.

## Features

- Create and mint unique profile NFTs
- Customize profile attributes based on DeFi activities
- Automated profile image generation
- On-chain verification of achievements

## NFT Attributes

The NFT system consists of 4 main attributes, and each profile NFT includes a randomly selected background to add uniqueness:

1. **Face (Deposit)**: Represents deposit activities

   - Includes variations like Droopy (Aave V3), Wide-Eyed (Artemis), etc.

2. **Gloves (Bridge)**: Represents bridge activities

   - Features Pink (Stargate V2), Yellow (Symbiosis)

3. **Shoes (Swap)**: Represents swap activities

   - Includes variations for different tokens (METIS, m.USDT, m.USDC, etc.)

4. **Special (Optional)**: Custom attributes

**Background**: Automatically and randomly selected from:

- Common backgrounds: Lavender, Mint, Pink, Beige, etc.
- Rare backgrounds (Chain specific): Spring, Twilight, Rainbow

Each item has a unique ID calculated by: `256 * itemId + attrId`

## Sample Profile NFT

Here's an example of a Profile NFT:

![Sample Profile NFT](./sample.png)

This profile represents a user who has:

- Used Artemis protocol for deposits (Wide-Eyed face, ID: 512)
- Performed cross-chain transactions via Symbiosis bridge (Yellow gloves, ID: 257)
- Traded METIS tokens (Sky shoes, ID: 2)
- Randomly received the Twilight background

The combination of these attributes tells the story of the user's DeFi activities on Metis network. Each attribute is earned through specific activities:

- **Face**: Earned by depositing in Artemis protocol
- **Gloves**: Earned by using Symbiosis bridge
- **Shoes**: Earned by trading METIS tokens
- **Background**: Randomly assigned during profile creation
